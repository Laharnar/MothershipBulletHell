Year 0	Month 4	Day 26, as dated by resistance's callendar

We lost our main engine. It gave up after our last battle. Our engineers say we don't have any spare parts, which means we will just have to sit here until they shut us down.

Crew has calmed down a bit. First they got really gloomy after we told them everything. Some still hope, some don't want to leave their rooms, and just think about their life.

One engineers suggested salvaging the hostile carrier's engines, but I don't think it can happen, unless scouting force is small.
Most likely we will get overwhelmed by numbers and then self destruct with "glorious baang" as the cook would say it. 
Or maybe after holding for days, get destroyed by one suicide bomber or something. Or maybe crew will just give up.

It's kinda sad... I think I would be nice to finaly settle down somewhere.


No side is ever right. There is always a different view. Maybe we are actualy the bad ones here...

* Find a way to destroy enemy carrier without using engines



Year 0	Month 1 Day 27, as dated by resistance's callendar

We got lucky. I think their officers though we were completly broken down, so they didn't send much.
We didn't get the spare parts though so we will have to abandon this ship. We will go undercover in captured enemy carrier and 
see what we can do from there. I will pose as lowest ranking officer that survived the resistance's raid. Sadly we will have to use our fallen
teammates's bodies as evidence of raid. Unless they have forensic teams ready, it should buy us enough time to make fake identities and blend into the crowd.

To anyone who ready this log. This log was fired in a rescue pod of enemy ship. Dead officers in it are hostile officers of the ship we took.

Also, on the bright side, our cook added one pot of honey in every pod of our ship, and one of engineers made a nuclear reactor-powered coolers for every pod from suiciders engines.
Whoever gets it, enjoy one of the last pots of honey we had on the best junk of a ship we could ever hope to find.


No side is ever right. There is always a different view. And maybe the honey will go bad before someone finds it, after reactor will break down in few million years...
