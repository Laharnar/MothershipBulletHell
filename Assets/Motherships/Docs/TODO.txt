15.9.2016
Added implementation of formation movement with minion-based model where minions copy change in leaders movement and rotation.

Warp gates can detect when units enter and exit.

Engines now have another base layer with completly basic translation forward.
Standard engines now allow 100% startup in instantiation. Useful for exiting from warp gates

You can have engine track their position and rotation changes.

16.9.2016

Todo:
When exit warp gate, units should appear and their actual engines should start working. if minions come out first, they still copy the leader.

Leader based enable-disable engine should be used with all types of engines.

Make spawner editor that creates entire level from predefined formation choice of empties based on their sizes.
Spawner should allows randomization of position by steps.

Make parser that allows string based waves. This is big task, break it down more, like how are formation prefabs kept and tagged


DevMakeLeader is probably broken in this new version
