This file explains all connections between layers.

Layers:
- Spaceship
- Detecton
- Collision Detection
- Navigation
- Selection

************************
Spaceship layer
This layer is for object with spaceship's main collider, the non trigger one.

Possible interactions:
Spaceship
Detection
All

*******************
Detection layer
This layer is for objects that require detection optimization. It could be spaceship layer, but for sake
of clearance it's a seprate layer.
Edit 4.9.2016
Assign this layer to gun ranges and ships detection range, so they can detect each other.
Edit 9.9.2016
Combine this layer and collision detection layer for target finding.


Possible interactions:
Spaceship
Detection
Collision Detection
**********************
Collision Detection layer
This layer is for ships, to be able to collide with projectiles or other ships
Assign it to ships child colliders.

Possible interactions:
Detection
Projectile

**********************
Selection layer
This layer is used only on selectable subobjects. They don't collide or trigger anything, only allow use of Raycasting and OverlapAreaAll.

Possible interactions:
NONE(accept Physics2D.Raycast)

*******************
Navigation layer
Layers for waypoints and waypoints detection, designed for spaceships manevuers.

Put 1 layer end on spaceship's child navigation collider and other on a waypoint.
Set these colliders on triggers

Possible interactions:
Navigation layer
