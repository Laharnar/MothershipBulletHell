MOVE INSTEAD OF DESTROY
void MoveInsideScreen(Transform obj) {
    if (obj.position.x > 200) { // allows +-200
        Vector3 npos = obj.position;
        npos.x -= 300;
        obj.position = npos;
    }
}

void MoveOutsideScreen(Transform obj) {
    if (obj.position.x < 290) { // allows +-290
        Vector3 npos = obj.position;
        npos.x += 300;
        obj.position = npos;
    }
}


SMOOTH ENGINE, non lerped, but smiliar
[in update]
MoveTowards(customPoint);
transform.Translate(direction * speed);
			
[System.Obsolete("this way, combined with transform.Translate(direction * speed); give REALLY smooth movement. Its little smiliar to lerp, "+
    "but better slowdown. Don't throw it away")]
public void MoveTowards(Vector3 point) {
        
    direction = point - transform.position;
    if (direction.x > 0) {
        direction.x = 1;
    }
    if (direction.y > 0) {
        direction.y = 1;
    }
    this.customPoint = point;
}

TODO and recap
24.9 2016
Add progression system for turrets. 
[turret)ground -> click -> open menu -> [menu)click menu item -> change turret into something else
[menu)click outside -> close menu, *--turret is also included in deselect i think--
[turret) click turret again -> close menu

Today I added waves, units and pathfinding

For pathfinding I have 2 options, either custom paths for all possible paths or branching, more node based paths

I could use system that allows one waypoint to have multiple exists that can then be chosen randomly by the unit.
Path choice should be easy to make once unit arrives.

Do i need global spawn manager? No I can spawn unit in starting wypoint and then it decides on itself where to go

Hint how to counter armor, what is armor good against
Wave 6: mix or orcs and goblins
Groups of same enemies spawn in same group

Wave 7: 16 goblins
How to cope with large numbers - seconds, meteor skill
You can spawn next wave immediatly after wave ends.
Start and end of wave have small delays
Skills can be canceled by clicking their icon again.
Skill works as Select skill(skill mode)-> Place skill || Cancel skill

End:  visctory screen with continue and ----------------

______________
*******************
Conclusion on wave 1-2, before going to lol
Most important pieces of game, to watch for, are combination of enemies and correct use of timings in waves.

________________
Level 3
Focus on building system
Ok so before I start, building poles have shadows
Hovering over building location will highlight it with handpainted yellow outline
Clicking it display build UI. it has 4 options. its custom made for 4 items, with diferent options.
Menu is of a square shape.
Clicking it again, closes ui and dehighlits it.
that build bar is the same for all, just different button placement
*******************

Goblins have low hp and average speed.
20hp, 1-4 atk, armor:none, lives taken=1

Orcs have light armor and slow speed

Wolves can dodge military attacks, low hp, "very" high speed
*regular minions -> regular heavy units -> regular fast unit
1-3 atk, like military
